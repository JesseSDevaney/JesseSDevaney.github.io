									<h2>Resources for Mindfulness</h2>
									<p>The resources I list below are intended for those who are (and those who are not so) curious about seeking more wisdom, better health, longer-lasting and more stable happiness, and freedom from suffering. I included those who are not so curious, because they may be the ones who would benefit the most from these resources.</p>

The way modern society views the relationship between ourselves and the environment has limited our ability to understand the true nature of reality.

You cannot explain one without the other.</li>

What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away?
